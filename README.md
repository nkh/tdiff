# DESCRIPTION

***tdiff*** presents a diff between two directories, as one or two trees, highlighting differences.

I wrote *tdiff* because I couldn't find a TUI application with the functionality I needed. If you know of any please let me know.

I wrote *tdiff* for myself so it fits my needs and taste, and environment, but I hope it will be useful to other.

Ideas, discussions, and patches are welcome. 

## Highlighting

One or two trees with highlighted differences are displayed in the terminal depending on the mode.

- missing file in one of the trees are displayed with a red background
- files with differences have a yellow background

While working in *tdiff* you may modify, delete, or copy files, the background color will be adjusted to reflect the change.

- if you delete a file it will be displayed with a red background, lighter in color so you can see the difference between the files that didn't exist and those you have removed
- copied files are displayed with a blue background
- merged files are displayed with a green background

## Modes

Default mode: **common**

| mode        | operation                                            | usage                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| all         | show all the files in the directories                | for general directory diffs                |
| common      | show all the files that are different or deleted     | for synchronizing directories              |
| diff        | show a single tree with the files that are different | for fixing merge conflicts                 |
| all_d2_only | show a single tree for directory 2                   | prototype mode with diffs in a single tree |

## Diff refresh

There are bindings to change mode but be aware that the mode trees are not automatically synchronized.

A quick explanation ...

- *tdiff* efficiently generates all the trees simultaneously before presenting its UI
- different modes have different trees
- interactive modification don't re-generated the trees, they only color them

What's the case to be aware of?

- in the modes that list identical files, *all* and *d2_only*
- you modify only one of the file, thus making them different
- you change to a mode which doesn't display identical files, *common* or *diff*

The file you have modified will not be listed because it wasn't in the tree when generated.

The above case is not different from a file being changed by another process. 

***You can manually refresh the diff.***

# Current entry and movements

***tdiff's top line is the current entry.***

Apart from the up/down movements you can:

- jump 
	- to the next/previous change
	- to the next/previous difference
	- to the next/previous entry at the same path depth
	- to the next/previous entry at a lower path depth
- search for a changed file
- search for any file

## Fixing differences in files, ie: git merge conflicts

Pressing **Return** will open the files in *vimdiff* (configurable)

If the *auto_advance* variable is set and the files are identical after editing, the next difference will be selected. 

## A file on one side and nothing on the other side

The file that exists will be open in *vim*.

## Copy files and directories

You can copy files or directories from one side to the other using <cl> or <cr>. If you try to copy a file that doesn't exist the file in the other tree will be deleted.

## Delete files or directories

You can delete files and directories on one side or on both sides.

## File management

If you configure a file manager, you can open both tree in it, see the configuration for an example.

## Divers functions

Copy the paths to the clipboard.

# Bindings

See ***Paneless*** for default bindings https://github.com/nkh/paneless

## Tdiff bindings

| cr      | copy to right side           |
| yy      | copy both path to clipboard  |
| yl      | copy left path to clipboard  |
| yr      | copy right path to clipboard |
| ENTER   | open diff/file/directory     |
| F       | open file manager            |
| i       | display stats                |
| AL      | flip Action Left             |
| ZL      | flip line number overlay     |
| ZL      | flip line total              |

# CONFIGURATION

At the top of the *tdiff.pless* file you will find these configuration variables, they will be moved to a configuration file in future versions.

```bash
# diff colors
DELETED=$'...'
DIFF=$'...'
ONLY=$'...'

# color for elements you have manipulated
INT_DELETED=$'...'
INT_DIFF=$'...'
INT_COPIED=$'...'
INT_SYNCHED=$'...'

auto_advance=1             # go to next file diff automatically
confirmation=              # set to 1 to confirm actions
left_side_action=1         # allow "delete in" / "copy to" the left side tree 

DIFF_TOOL=vimdiff
FILE_EDIT=vim
DIR_EDIT=open_in_ftl

open_in_ftl() { tabs= ; for p in "$PWD/$1/$3" "$PWD/$2/$3" ; do [[ -e "$p" ]] && tabs+="$p$'\n'" ; done ; tmux new-window "ftl -t <(echo -n "$tabs")" ; }
```
They reflect my environment so you'll need to set them up if they don't match yours. You certainly will have to set your file manager.

## Color Vision Deficiencies

You can set colors and intensities that suits you best in the configuration and also use the terminal codes below. Let me know what worked best for you.

| code  | effect        |
| ----- | ------------- |
| \e[3m | italic        |
| \e[4m | underline     |
| \e[5m | blinking      |
| \e[9m | strikethrough |

## Extra Config

### Sort order

	LC_COLLATE=C tdiff test1 test2

### Limiting entry types by passing argument to *find(1)*

	TDFA='-type d' tdiff test/dir*
