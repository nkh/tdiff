synch files and directories

parallel diff
	find n non overlapping largest directories
	diff n directories &
	diff -exclude n directories

	n directories not necessarily at root of dirs to diff

	n directories not necessarily same in directory structure
		can't compare to nothing
			but also means that everything under is automatically in the diff
			those are found by diffing the files list not running diff

new mode
	compare dir 2 to  dir 1
		no coloring in dir  1
		show new files in dir 2 instead for deleted in dir 1

	remove dir 1
		no color and no added information
		
	it's just added file to dir2 that need to be colored accordingly


diff options compatibility with -q
	-b will not ignore the difference

delete
	not deleted file -> colored differently
